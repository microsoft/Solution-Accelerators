# Solution Accelerator Repository

This is a central hub for solution accelerators that are pre-built, open-source solutions designed to accelerate proof of value. They provide a starting point for the most common scenarios and are adaptable to partners' and customers' business needs. 

## Cloud and AI Solution Accelerators

### Content Processing
Users can process claims, invoices, contracts and other documents containing text, images, tables and graphs quickly and accurately by extracting information from unstructured content and mapping it to a structured format. This solution enables machine-to-machine, API-driven content processing pipelines to automate data workflows.

### Modernize your code
Empower users to effortlessly migrate legacy code, leveraging AI to streamline processes, reduce manual effort, and enhance operational efficiency. The accelerator utilizes an agentic framework for code conversion, with each agent playing a specialized role in analyzing, converting, and testing SQL queries.

### Build your own copilot
Users can see in action how to create their own copilots using Azure OpenAI Service, Azure AI Search, and Microsoft Fabric. The repository includes reusable architecture, code snippets, and deployment scripts to help accelerate AI projects.

#### Client Advisor
This copilot helps client advisors to save time and prepare relevant discussion topics for scheduled meetings. It provides an overview of daily client meetings with seamless navigation between viewing client profiles and chatting with structured data. Altogether, these features streamline meeting preparation for the advisors and result in more productive conversations with clients.

#### Researcher
This copilot helps the researchers find relevant articles and grants available for their research topic easily using a conversational assistant. Researcher can generate different sections of a grant application with a simple button click, then they can refine the prompts and regenerate individual sections to add more details as needed. Finally, the generated grant application can be exported as a PDF or a Microsoft Word document for further processing.

### Knowledge Mining
Users can see how to accelerate decision making at scale with intelligence that uncovers insights, relationships, and patterns from large data sets. We have two repositories that cover different topics: document knowledge mining and conversation knowledge mining. Both repositories include reusable architecture, code snippets, and deployment scripts to help accelerate AI projects.

#### Conversation Knowledge Mining
This solution maximizes contact center efficiency and customer satisfaction by utilizing AI driven knowledge mining enabled by Fabric, Azure Speech Service and Azure OpenAI Service. Gain valuable post-conversation insights to inform actions, improve product offerings, optimize operational efficiency and improve customer experience.
